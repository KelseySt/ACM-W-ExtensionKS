# ACM-W Project#1

Our first project is building a [Chrome Extension](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions). The chrome extension is designed to be a simple popup that counts down to the next school break the user inputs, or more broadly, the closest date the user inputs. The final project code is available along with step by step starter code. It's designed to be completed in three parts (three 1hr meetings) that cover HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.

The required manifest file and sample icon is included.

>[!NOTE]
